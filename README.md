In this project, I developed a simple calculator microservice using Node.js and the Express framework. The microservice was designed to handle basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) by providing corresponding API endpoints. I started by setting up the development environment, installing Node.js and Express, and initializing a new Node.js project using npm init -y. After creating the main application file (index.js), I implemented four GET routes for each arithmetic operation (/add, /subtract, /multiply, /divide). Each endpoint accepts two query parameters (num1 and num2) and performs the corresponding arithmetic operation, returning the result to the client. Error handling was implemented to ensure that the input parameters were valid numbers, with specific checks for invalid input and division by zero. After testing the microservice locally by running the server on port 3000, I created a GitHub repository to host the code and documentation.
